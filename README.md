A homepage that looks amazing no matter the device or display size

This project implements everything that I have learned about responsive design, which is just a fancy word for making our website look good and run good no matter the display size. This is really important as there are billions of displays ranging from the smallest phone to the widest monitor today. By making websites run smoothly no matter what it is being viewed from, we can ensure a streamlined and easy use of our websites in all situations.

This will be achieved primarily using natural responsiveness. Natural responsiveness is the idea that plain HTML is ***naturally*** responsive and we should utilize that to our advantage by adding CSS upon plain HTML rather than simply overriding it. More complex cases can be solved with media queries and HTML elements make specifically for responsive images. This project is also a great candidate to practice my new accessibility (a11y) knowledge which makes website more accessible and easier to use for all.
