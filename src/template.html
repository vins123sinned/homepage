            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>What's up guys, thanks for taking the time to look through my homepage and read about me. I'll keep it short and sweet, beginning with the fact that I am born and raised in Las Vegas
                with a couple of years in Fuzhou, China. Growing up I always had an affinity toward technology and everything about it came easy to me. I kept up this hobby over the years and now in 2025 I
                am learning programming in hopes of getting a wealthy sometime soon. Beside that, I am also trying to relearn Chinese as I've slacked off and forgotten some of the language (oops) and I also enjoy cooking,
                exercising, anime, and travel! I always wanted to make something of my life but procrastinated for most of my life, so I am excited to see where I end up in the future with this endeavor and I also hope that 
                you will see that I become successful with me! Well that's all for now, you have a great day whoever's reading this ðŸ˜Ž.
            </p>
